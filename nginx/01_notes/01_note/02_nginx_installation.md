## üîπ How Nginx Installs in WSL vs Node.js

### 1. Node.js installation style

* When you install Node.js (or `npm install something`), the files usually sit inside your **project folder** (`node_modules/`) or under your **user folder**.
* It feels ‚Äútemporary‚Äù because you can delete the folder, and boom ‚Üí gone.
* Node.js is usually tied to your project.

---

### 2. Nginx installation style

* Nginx is **not project-based** like Node.js.
* When you do:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  ```

  It installs Nginx **system-wide inside WSL‚Äôs Linux environment**.

  That means:

  * Configs ‚Üí `/etc/nginx/`
  * Web root (default HTML files) ‚Üí `/var/www/html/`
  * Logs ‚Üí `/var/log/nginx/`
  * Binary (program itself) ‚Üí `/usr/sbin/nginx`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This has nothing to do with your Windows `nginx-learning` folder. Nginx won‚Äôt store its files in your Desktop folder. It installs in the Linux filesystem that WSL maintains separately.

---

### 3. Permanent or Temporary?

* It‚Äôs **permanent inside WSL** ‚Üí just like installing Chrome or VS Code in Windows.
* If you close the terminal, reboot Windows, or reopen WSL ‚Üí Nginx is still there.
* It will **only be removed if you uninstall it**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt remove nginx
  ```
* Or if you delete/reset your entire WSL distro.

üëâ So it‚Äôs **not like Node.js `node_modules`** that you delete per project. It‚Äôs more like a ‚Äúprogram installation‚Äù.

---

### 4. Your Windows folder (`nginx-learning`)

* Right now, it‚Äôs just a normal folder.
* If you want, you can **serve files from that folder with Nginx**, but you have to tell Nginx in its config:

  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      root /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Desktop/nginx-learning;
      index index.html;
  }
  ```

  Then Nginx will serve files directly from your Windows Desktop folder üöÄ.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Installing Nginx in WSL ‚Üí permanent, system-wide, not tied to your Desktop folder.
* Your `nginx-learning` folder is just a workspace. By default, Nginx won‚Äôt touch it.
* If you want Nginx to serve from that folder, you must point its config (`root` directive) there.

## üîπ How to Start with Nginx

### Install Nginx

Depending on your system:

* **Ubuntu/Debian (Linux):**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nginx
  ```

* **CentOS/RHEL:**

  ```bash
  sudo yum install nginx
  ```

* **Windows:**
  You can [download Nginx for Windows](https://nginx.org/en/download.html) but it‚Äôs mostly used on Linux. (For practice, use WSL on Windows.)

* **Mac (with Homebrew):**

  ```bash
  brew install nginx
  ```

## üîπ 1: (for wsl ubuntu) Update your Ubuntu packages

Open your WSL terminal (Ubuntu) and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## üîπ 2: Install Nginx

Run:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

This installs Nginx inside your Ubuntu WSL system.

# ‚úÖ Now, How to Access & Edit Nginx Config Files in VS Code (from WSL)

### 1. After installing Nginx

On your **WSL Ubuntu terminal**, check if Nginx config folder exists:

```sh
cd /etc/nginx
```

If Nginx is installed, you‚Äôll be inside the folder.
Now list files:

```sh
ls
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```sh
conf.d          koi-utf     modules-available  proxy_params     sites-enabled  win-utf
fastcgi.conf    koi-win     modules-enabled    scgi_params      snippets
fastcgi_params  mime.types  nginx.conf         sites-available  uwsgi_params
```

This confirms Nginx is installed and config files are available. üéâ

---

### 2. Open Nginx folder in **VS Code**


#### üîπ Method 1: Open via Windows Explorer

1. Open **File Explorer** in Windows.
2. In the address bar, type:

   ```
   \\wsl$\Ubuntu\etc\nginx
   ```

   (Replace `Ubuntu` with your WSL distro name if different.)
3. Right-click the folder ‚Üí **Open with Code**.
   Or drag the folder into VS Code.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If you open files this way, you may need **admin privileges** to save, since `/etc/nginx` is a system folder.

### So this is very problametic ignore this step

---

#### üîπ Method 2: Using Remote - WSL (Recommended)

### step 1: Install the **Remote Development** extension in VS Code (it includes everyting).


---

### Step 2: Launch Remote WSL from normal vs-code

From your **Windows VS Code** (not terminal):

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí search **‚ÄúWSL:Connect to WSL in New Window‚Äù** ‚Üí press Enter.
2. A new VS Code window will open with **`>< WSL: Ubuntu`** in the bottom-left corner.
   This installs the proper **VS Code Server** inside your WSL automatically.

---

### Step 3: Use VS Code‚Äôs built-in terminal

In that new **WSL VS Code window**:

1. Open the terminal inside VS Code (\`Ctrl+\`\` or Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal).

   * This terminal is **already inside WSL** but with the correct VS Code integration.
2. Run:

   ```sh
   code -v
   ```

üëâ You should now see something like:

```
1.94.2
abcdef12345
x64
```

---

### Step 4: Open your Nginx config

Finally, open the folder:

```sh
code /etc/nginx
```

Now you can edit configs directly in VS Code. üéâ

> Saving works smoothly, because Remote - WSL handles permissions.


---
---
---


## And also if you dont want to do vs-code involved in it then simply use the vim directly in the wsl ubuntu terminal

#### Using vim ou can do anything to the `nginx.conf` file

```sh
cd /etc/nginx

sudo vi nginx.conf
# Using sudo is necessary because /etc/nginx/nginx.conf requires root permissions.
# update, save, exit (it will directly saves it no need advanced permissions)

sudo nginx -t # to test the configuration file 
sudo systemctl reload nginx
# if systemctl doesn‚Äôt work in WSL:
sudo service nginx reload
```


### all the things matter is the nginx.conf file, we have to work with that file only
