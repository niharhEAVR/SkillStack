### Your block:

```nginx
location /vegetables {
    root /mnt/d/My_Workings/SkillStack/nginx/02_codes;
    try_files /vegetables/veggies.html /01_index.html = 404;
}
```

---

## 🔹 1️⃣ `location /vegetables`

* This block **matches any request URL starting with `/vegetables`**.
* Example URLs it matches:

  ```
  /vegetables
  /vegetables/
  /vegetables/abc
  ```

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ `root /mnt/d/.../02_codes;`

* This tells Nginx **where to look for the files on disk**.
* With `root`, Nginx will **combine `root` + request URI** to find the file.

Example:

```
Request: /vegetables/veggies.html
Path Nginx looks for: /mnt/d/.../02_codes/vegetables/veggies.html
```

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ `try_files`

```nginx
try_files /vegetables/veggies.html /01_index.html =404;
```

**Meaning:**

1. Look for `/vegetables/veggies.html` **inside the root folder**.
2. If it doesn’t exist, look for `/01_index.html` (fallback).
3. If neither exists, return **404 Not Found**.

---

### 🔹 Step-by-step example

Assume your files:

```
/mnt/d/My_Workings/SkillStack/nginx/02_codes/
├── 01_index.html
└── vegetables/
    └── veggies.html
```

| Request URL            | File Served                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/vegetables/`         | `/vegetables/veggies.html` → exists → served ✅                     |
| `/vegetables/abc`      | `/vegetables/veggies.html` → exists → served ✅                     |
| `/vegetables/missing`  | `/vegetables/veggies.html` → exists → served ✅                     |
| `/vegetables/xyz.html` | `/vegetables/veggies.html` → exists → served ✅                     |
| `/vegetables/none`     | `/vegetables/veggies.html` → missing → `/01_index.html` → served ✅ |
| `/vegetables/404.html` | Neither → `404 Not Found` ❌                                        |

---

### 🔹 🔹 Why use `try_files`?

* It’s **like a fallback system**.
* Often used for:

  * Single-page apps (SPA) → fallback to `index.html`.
  * Serving default files if requested file is missing.

---

💡 **Important:**

* In your block, the first path in `try_files` is **absolute relative to root**, not URL.
* If you had written `veggies.html` instead of `/vegetables/veggies.html`, it would also work because Nginx combines `root + URI`.

## Your block

```nginx
location ~* /count/[0-9] {
    root /mnt/d/My_Workings/SkillStack/nginx/02_codes;
    try_files /01_index.html = 404;
}
```

### 🔹 What it means

1. `location ~* /count/[0-9]`

   * `~*` → **case-insensitive regex match**
   * `/count/[0-9]` → matches URLs like:

     ```
     /count/1
     /count/5
     /count/9
     ```

     (any single digit after `/count/`)

2. `root /mnt/d/...` → points to your project folder.

3. `try_files /01_index.html =404;`

   * Ignores the URL, **always serves `/01_index.html`** if it exists.
   * If `/01_index.html` is missing → return 404.

### 🔹 Summary

* This block is likely for a **dynamic or SPA-like route**: `/count/` pages always serve the main HTML file, and the front-end JavaScript handles the rest.
* It ensures that `/count/1`, `/count/2`, etc., don’t return 404 even though those files don’t exist on disk.

---

* **`location ~* /count/[0-9]`** → regex block for specific routes that **always fallback to a single HTML file**, useful for SPA or dynamic pages.

> **so if i visits the http://localhost:8080/count/0 to 9 i will get only the page for that conf**



Exactly! ✅

Here’s what happens in your config:

```nginx
location ~* /count/[0-9] {
    root /mnt/d/My_Workings/SkillStack/nginx/02_codes;
    try_files /01_index.html = 404;
}
```

---

### 🔹 URL matches

* Regex `/count/[0-9]` matches **only a single digit** after `/count/`.
  So URLs like:

  ```
  /count/0
  /count/1
  /count/5
  /count/9
  ```

  → match this block.

* URLs like `/count/10` or `/count/12` → **do NOT match**, so Nginx falls back to `location /` or returns 404.

---

### 🔹 What file will be served

* `try_files /01_index.html =404;` → Nginx **ignores the URL** and always serves:

```
/mnt/d/My_Workings/SkillStack/nginx/02_codes/01_index.html
```

* So **all URLs `/count/0` to `/count/9` show the same page**.

---

### 🔹 Why this is useful

* Often used in **single-page apps (SPA)**:

  * The front-end JS reads the URL (`/count/3`)
  * Dynamically shows the content for that number
  * Nginx doesn’t need separate HTML files for each URL

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Visiting `/count/0` → serves `01_index.html`
* Visiting `/count/1` → serves `01_index.html`
* … up to `/count/9`
* Visiting `/count/10` → **does not match regex**, will either go to `location /` or 404

---
---
---

### Your block:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

---

## 🔹 Step 1: `location /`

* This matches **all URLs** that start with `/`.
* Essentially, it’s the **default block for your site**.

Examples of URLs it matches:

```
/
 /index.html
 /style.css
 /fruits/apple.html
 /count/10
```

---

## 🔹 Step 2: `try_files $uri $uri/ =404;`

`try_files` tells Nginx **what order to check for files**.

1. **`$uri`** → the exact URL path requested by the browser.

   Example:

   * URL: `/style.css`
   * Nginx looks for: `/mnt/.../02_codes/style.css`
   * If it exists → serve it.

2. **`$uri/`** → treat it as a directory and look for `index.html` inside that directory.

   Example:

   * URL: `/fruits/`
   * Nginx looks for: `/mnt/.../02_codes/fruits/index.html`
   * If it exists → serve it.

3. **`=404`** → if neither exists, return a **404 Not Found**.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Examples

| URL                  | `$uri` exists? | `$uri/` exists?            | Served file          |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/index.html`        | Yes            | —                          | `/index.html`        |
| `/style.css`         | Yes            | —                          | `/style.css`         |
| `/fruits/`           | No             | Yes → `/fruits/index.html` | `/fruits/index.html` |
| `/fruits/apple.html` | Yes            | —                          | `/fruits/apple.html` |
| `/nonexistent.html`  | No             | No                         | 404 Not Found        |

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Why this is used

* This is a **standard static file serving pattern**.
* It lets you:

  1. Serve individual files (CSS, HTML, JS).
  2. Serve directories automatically (`/fruits/` → `/fruits/index.html`).
  3. Give a 404 if nothing matches.

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

> `location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }`
> is basically Nginx saying:
> “For any URL:
>
> 1. Serve the file if it exists.
> 2. If it’s a folder, serve `index.html`.
> 3. Otherwise, show 404.”
